### Improved Recipe Testing & Inventory Management

We've made significant improvements to how recipe testing works in ScentedHub. When you test a recipe now, the system more accurately tracks the materials used, ensuring your inventory stays perfectly in sync. This means you'll always have reliable information about your available supplies and won't run into surprises when starting a new test.&#x20;

We've also added better validation to prevent accidental over-use of materials - the system will now clearly warn you if you don't have enough of any ingredient before you start a test. This helps prevent wasted materials and ensures more consistent test results. These updates make the recipe testing process more reliable and help you maintain better control over your inventory, ultimately saving you time and reducing waste in your candle-making process.

The key benefits include:

* More accurate inventory tracking during recipe testing

* Better prevention of material shortages

* Clearer warnings before starting tests

* Reduced risk of wasted materials

* More reliable test results

* Improved inventory accuracy

These improvements help ensure your candle-making process runs more smoothly and efficiently, with fewer interruptions due to inventory issues.
